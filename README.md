# DGIM - Implementing DGIM in Java

In the data stream model, some or all of the input is represented as a finite sequence of integers (from some finite domain) which is generally not available for random access, but instead arrives one at a time in a "stream". If the stream has length n and the domain has size m, algorithms are generally constrained to use space that is logarithmic in m and n. They can generally make only some small constant number of passes over the stream, sometimes just one.


Instructions to run the program : 

1. Run the python file "serverInt" the server takes three parameters "--help" to get the parameters

2. After runnin the server compile and run P1.java
